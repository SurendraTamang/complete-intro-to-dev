# CSS Notes
Three terms used in css are:
* css selector

This is the part of the css that defines what elements are selected. For example, if you want to select all the paragraphs in a document, you would use the selector `p`.

* css property

This is the part of the css that defines what the selected element should look like. For example, if you want to make all the paragraphs in a document bold, you would use the property `font-weight`.


* css value

This is the part of the css that defines what the selected element should look like. For example, if you want to make all the paragraphs in a document bold, you would use the value `bold`.

Complete Example:
```css
p {
    font-weight: bold;
}
```
